Being submissive, hmm.. Not an easy thing. But when God Himself became submissive for me, who am I to rebel.

# Titus 3: 1-11
<sup>1</sup>Remind them to be submissive to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work, <sup>2</sup> to speak evil of no one, to avoid quarreling, to be gentle, and to show perfect courtesy toward all people. <sup>3</sup> For we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, slaves to various passions and pleasures, passing our days in malice and envy, hated by others and hating one another. <sup>4</sup> But when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared, <sup>5</sup> he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, <sup>6</sup> whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, <sup>7</sup> so that being justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life. <sup>8</sup> The saying is trustworthy, and I want you to insist on these things, so that those who have believed in God may be careful to devote themselves to good works. These things are excellent and profitable for people. <sup>9</sup> But avoid foolish controversies, genealogies, dissensions, and quarrels about the law, for they are unprofitable and worthless. <sup>10</sup> As for a person who stirs up division, after warning him once and then twice, have nothing more to do with him, <sup>11</sup> knowing that such a person is warped and sinful; he is self-condemned.

## React

v1. Rulers and authorities are there for a God’s divine purpose. My duty is to obey them. Proactively get involved in every good work.<br>
v2. Bonding between people, everyone is in God’s image.. So don’t fight with the difference, rather be kind and gentle, especially towards their attitude.<br>
v3-5. Is it fine to be polite to rude, irritating people. If Yes why? Coz even me myself was foolish, yet God saved me and showed mercy. So it's completely fine and it's mandatory to show politeness especially to rude people.<br>
v7. We are justified to be children of God.. We have a ticket to eternal life.<br>
v8. So be devoted to do good works, because I am no longer an earthly human, but an heir of eternal God.<br>
v9. Avoid foolish talks, quarrels about laws.. They are useless.<br>
v10-11. There will be people who cause division, warn them and leave them.. Don’t go and quarrel back, then there will be no difference between you and that person.<br>
