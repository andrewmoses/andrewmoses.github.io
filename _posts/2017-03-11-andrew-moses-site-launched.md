I always wanted to write a blog. OK not specifically a blog, but I wanted to write something. But, I was hesitant, cause of many reasons – one of them is .. “Na peter illa da” - A phrase in Tamil usually used to mean “I'm not good in English”. So prepare yourself! You are going to travel through many grammatical errors.

I created this site using github pages, hence my first blog is going to be [Starting with github pages](http://andrewmoses.github.io).
