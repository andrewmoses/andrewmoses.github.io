For what should I hope in Jesus?


# 1 Corinthians 15: 12-22
<sup>12</sup>Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? <sup>13</sup> But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. <sup>14</sup> And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain. <sup>15</sup> We are even found to be misrepresenting God, because we testified about God that he raised Christ, whom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised. <sup>16</sup> For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised. <sup>17</sup> And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins. <sup>18</sup> Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. <sup>19</sup> If in Christ we have hope in this life only, we are of all people most to be pitied. <br><br>
<sup>20</sup> But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. <sup>21</sup> For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead. <sup>22</sup> For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.

## Observation

v12. A question: When Christ is proclaimed to be resurrected from the dead. How can some people tell that there is no resurrection?<br>
v13. If "no resurrection" is valid. Then even Christ is not resurrected/cannot be resurrected.<br>
v14. If Christ is not resurrected then preaching is in vain, faith is in vain.<br>
v15. If no resurrection is valid. Then the gospel is misrepresenting God. Because it was said that God raised Jesus Christ from the dead.<br>
v16. If dead will not be resurrected. Then even Christ did not resurrect.<br>
v17. And if Christ did not resurrect that means the faith will become useless and people will still be in sin.<br>
v18. Even the dead believers will perish.<br>
v19. If the hope in Christ is for this earthly life only, then of all people, the above belief people would be the most pitiable.<br>
v20. But hold on, indeed Christ was resurrected. The first fruits among the dead/fallen asleep.<br>
v21. By one man A came death.<br>
Similarly by another man J came resurrection of the dead.<br>
v22. As by Adam all died.<br>
Similarly as by Jesus all shall be made alive.<br>

## Interpretation

Why did Paul tell this?<br>
What was the misconception in people's mind that made Paul to tell this?<br>
* From v19 and v12: The misconception(ed) people believed and hoped in Christ - Christ as the Messiah/the Savior. But the same misconception(ed) people did not believe in resurrection of the dead (sadducees idealogy refer mark 12:18).<br>
* Typical worry of a man/woman in earth: What am I to do today/tomorrow or in near future or distant future (as in earth).<br>
* Very difficult to think beyond death.<br>
* Ironically Paul states if I am not capable of thinking beyond death and hoping in Christ only for this earthly life. I am to be the most pitiable.<br>

Courtesy: Temple run resurrection wings and Valorant sage revival power. Resurrection is something which is absorbed in many people's mind.
<br><br>

v12. Some people did not believe in the afterlife/resurrection.<br>
v13. "No resurrection" implies that even Christ was not resurrected. Christ cannot be taken as an exception and be told that only Christ can resurrect and others can't. No, at least not in this aspect. I guess in every aspect every human can live like Jesus.<br>
v14. So if Christ never resurrected. Preaching about Jesus the Messiah/the Savior is waste. Faith/believing in Jesus would be waste. What good is believing in a dead man.<br>
v15. It further implies that the preachers/believers were misrepresenting God- like a cult group. Because the preacher testified that God only resurrected Christ.<br>
v16. If dead can not be resurrected, then even Christ can't be resurrected.<br>
v17. Without resurrected Jesus. Faith becomes useless. People will be left in their sins. No one can approach God. B'coz with sin people cannot access Holy God.<br>
v18. Also the people who died before, the great leaders in Christ and poor (but great faith people) have perished. Just perished.. All their toil, all their sufferings perished.<br>
v19. So, if hope in Christ is just for a good earthly life(good job, house, car, .. ) then those people are to be most pitied. B'coz they missed the core matter of hoping in resurrected Christ.<br>
* Christ is much more. much deep than what is projected by various churches/people.<br>
* And now as resurrected Christ perspective. Hoping in Christ is much needed for the afterlife rather than just hoping for temporary worldly troubles/worries.<br><br>

v20. Christ in fact has been resurrected - "first fruits of those who have fallen asleep" (i have no clue wat is meant by the first fruits of those ... phrase).<br>
There is no reason (or) it simply cannot be said that Christ was not resurrected. There do exist an empty tomb. Jesus name above all names.. so powerful. A living resurrected God.<br>
v21. By Adam (a man) came death because man sinned.<br>
Similarly by Christ (a man) came resurrection because He defeated death.<br>
v22. As in adam: in sin all died<br>
As in Christ: resurrected God. We are all made alive. Alive in Christ not for earthly blessings/hope. But for an eternal lifestyle.<br>

Worrying about what God likes.<br>
Worrying about sick/hungry/addicted/troubled people around us.<br>
Worrying about equipping oneself to help others.<br>
Worrying about the purpose for which God created me.<br>

## Application

What/why I hope in Christ?<br><br>
* To excel in my work.<br>
* .. [you can put your personal desires here.. ]<br><br>

What can I hope in Christ for?<br><br>
* A life pleasing God.<br>
* In after life God telling: "Well done Andy"<br>

<br><br>
Can't a transformed life share the good news, not just in words, but good news being a reflection of one's life.<br><br>
What are the things that concerns me/you?

<br><br>

Thank you.
