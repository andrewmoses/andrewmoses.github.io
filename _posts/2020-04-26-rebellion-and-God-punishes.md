Motivated by well wishers. One of the productive things done during the Lockdown.

Ok. I am gonna share some of my insights on the below Bible portion.

# Hebrews 3: 7 - 19 ESV

Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says,

“Today, if you hear his voice,

do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion,
    
on the day of testing in the wilderness,

where your fathers put me to the test
    
and saw my works for forty years.

Therefore I was provoked with that generation,

and said, ‘They always go astray in their heart;
    
they have not known my ways.’

As I swore in my wrath,
    
‘They shall not enter my rest.’”

Take care, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away from the living God. But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called “today,” that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. For we have come to share in Christ, if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end. As it is said,

“Today, if you hear his voice,

do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.”

For who were those who heard and yet rebelled? Was it not all those who left Egypt led by Moses? And with whom was he provoked for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness? And to whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest, but to those who were disobedient? So we see that they were unable to enter because of unbelief.

## Analytics
Set 1: [you, your] = 8
Set 2: [heart] = 4
Set 3: [I, He, His, Holy Spirit, God, Christ, Me] = 15
Set 4: [unbelief, disobedient, sin, rebellion, sinned, unbelieving, evil, harden, provoked, rebelled] = 14

Set 1 refers to the reader (i.e, us). Set 3 refers to God. Set 4 refers to negative acts of humans. The values to the right side of equalTo symbol is the number of occurances of the set in the above passage.

At high level one can say, this passage focuses more about God and more or less about a set of evil acts done by humans.

## Background
Hebrews is a book in bible whose author is still unknown. Written between AD 60 and 70. Probably not written by Paul. B'coz all Paul's letters starts with "Paul an apostle .. " e.g. Timothy, Philemon, Titus.

Its a letter to the Hebrews. To encourage Christians in a time of trial. By focusing on absolute supremacy and sufficiency of Jesus Christ.

## Dive into passage
The passage starts off.. The Holy Spirit speaks. "Therefore". It implies that the passage is a conclusion.

Today if I hear His (God's) voice, I should not harden my heart (become stone hearted) as in the rebellion also known as Testing Day in the Wilderness [TDW].

Surprise! It was not a testing day for man. Rather man tested God, thats why the name <b>rebellion</b>

Test Results: Man had to see God's response for the test for 40 years // Man evaluated God's response for 40 years.
