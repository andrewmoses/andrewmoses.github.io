The Word = Life = The Light = Jesus Christ = God


# John 1:1-18
<sup>1</sup> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God <sup>2</sup> He was in the beginning with God. <sup>3</sup> All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. <sup>4</sup> In him was life, and the life was the light of men. <sup>5</sup> The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. <br><br>
<sup>6</sup> There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. <sup>7</sup> He came as a witness, to bear witness about the light, that all might believe through him. <sup>8</sup> He was not the light, but came to bear witness about the light. <br><br>
<sup>9</sup> The true light, which gives light to everyone, was coming into the world. <sup>10</sup> He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him. <sup>11</sup> He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him. <sup>12</sup> But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, <sup>13</sup> who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God. <br><br> 
<sup>14</sup> And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. <sup>15</sup> (John bore witness about him, and cried out, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me ranks before me, because he was before me.’”) <sup>16</sup> For from his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace. <sup>17</sup> For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. <sup>18</sup> No one has ever seen God; the only God, who is at the Father's side, he has made him known.

## Observation

  </div>
</div>

v3. The entire creation was made through the Word (Him)

v4. The Word had Life. Life = Light of men

v5. Light didn't exist separately, rather it was shining over the darkness. Another way of telling is absence of darkness is light (or) absence of light is darkness: they both can't be separated. Good thing is light is powerful than darkness.

v6. John the baptist and not the John the author of the book

v7. Light = Life = The Word = God: John came to witness God. Reason: So all might believe God.

v8. John Not Equal to Light. Only witness about the light

v9. This light is not tubelight or sunlight. But the True light. The true light gives light to everyone.

v10. The Word as the creator of the world. Yet world did not know the Word (Him).

v11. The world was His own (as he created it). Yet His own people did not receive Him

v12. Not all rejected Him, but some received Him. Reward for receiving Him: Child of God

v13. Born of God. Not a earthly human birth.

v14. The Word = God : became flesh and lived among man. The author John as seen His glory. His glory as only Son of Father God. Even though He became flesh. He was full of grace and truth.

v15. 

v16. From HIM: all received grace

v17. 

v18. No one had ever seen God. But | The Word: He has made the unseen God known to man




## Interpretation

v1.
* The Word as an entity was God. Trinity God (Jesus + Holy Spirit + Father God).
* The Word = Jesus (coz of v14)
 
* God Trinity ( 1 God ) created world together. Jesus existed before mary giving birth to baby Jesus and Jesus was God

v4.
* Jesus had life = light. 
 
* Light and darkness: its not about visible light and darkness. But something bigger/deeper.
 
* H_Light: doing good stuff: helping, caring, showing kindness.
* Darkness: bad stuff: lies, theft, betrayal
 
* Every human has both H_light and darkness

v5.
* Now J_light shines over darkness. Jesus capable of consuming the dark side of humans.
* Human's bad stuff can be stopped by Jesus.
* With J_light there is no bad stuff.

v9.
* J_light = True Light. Light to everyone, not a set of ritual people. But to all. Like the sun shine over all the earth.
* True light was specifically for the world. Not like the sun which is for the entire solar system.

v10.
* Even though World being created through Jesus, Humans did not know Jesus. Why?
* Humans were not created as robots (olden days robots) - controlled by remote. Rather Humans were created with free will and consciousness.

v11. Jesus expects His own (Humans, us) to receive Him. But not by force.

v12.
* It’s a choice to receive Jesus.
* When a Humans receive Jesus. He/She becomes a child of God.

v13.
* A rebirth experience. Not something which is of earthly kind (where a man and woman plans for a child). But something which is heavenly.
* Born of God: highest valued privilege. The highest grade. The pinnacle. Very different from earthly view point as it is heavenly. Something which is un-comparable.

v14.
* Glory of Jesus:
* Only Son (so precious to God).
* Full of grace and Truth: compassion. No lie. No fairy tale story. No masking. No hidden agenda. Just the Truth. Plain transparent truth. 
* Even though opposite of earth, even though many not receiving, yet with all confidence He lived with full grace and Truth.

v17.
* Law was given by God to Israelites, to show Humans the expectation of God. To be Holy (the recommended way of living a life).
* But Humans mishandled the God given law and using the same law people were condemned. Hence Jesus fulfilled the law and demonstrated the other key attributes of God which is Grace and Truth. 

v18. Only via Jesus we gain access to God.



## Application

v3. Everything was created by Jesus. Jesus can help me in everything. In coding. In my relationships with other people. In sickness. In pandemic

v4.
* My sins/mistakes/wrong doings can be vanished by Jesus.
* My temptations cannot overcome Jesus. With Jesus all the evil temptations and desires loses its hold.

v9. 
* A light which is so personal
* A light which exposes my hidden things which no one knows.
* A light which knows all my secrets.
* A light which knows the real me.
* A light which gives life to dead me.

v10. I have all the possibility to reject Jesus. Coz many have not received Jesus.

v11. Jesus' will for my life, is to receive Him. Not just knowing Him. But expects me to receive Him.

v12. Understand Andy, How great it is to be a Child of God. More than an experience, it is the highest privilege. More than CEO of Microsoft.

v14.
* If I am child of God. I should practice the qualities of God.
* I should be full of grace and truth.
