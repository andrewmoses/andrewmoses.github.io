I have compiled my insights about this wonderful passage (from the Bible). Ofcourse I couldn't unravel the big picture, but I believe I have given my best.

# Matthew 5: 1 - 12
1 *Seeing the crowds, he went up on the mountain, and when he sat down, his disciples came to him.*

**The Beatitudes**

2 *And he opened his mouth and taught them, saying:*

3 *“Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.*

4 *“Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.*

5 *“Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.*

6 *“Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.*

7 *“Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.*

8 *“Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.*

9 *“Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons[a] of God.*

10 *“Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.*

11 *“Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. 12 Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.*

## Intro to the passage

* Part of the **longest message** shared by Jesus (as recorded in bible) - the full message spans across three chapters (matt 5,6,7).
* Relatively first message (as recorded in bible).

Why this *(as recorded in bible)* ?

The thing is like, Jesus has shared many teachings before *Sermon on the Mount*, but the message was not recorded. For example: Matt 4: 23 - *..he went throughout all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues ..* but actual teaching was not recorded as the *Sermon on the Mount*.

### Timeline

1. Jesus gets baptized
2. Undergoes temptation episode
3. **Sermon on the mount**

> Luke 3:23 - Jesus started off His ministry at age: 30.

### Audience

* The Disciples
* Crowd - eager people who wanted to listen to Jesus.

## How great crowd ?

Why was there a great crowd? Obviously it was because of Jesus!

But wait, how did Jesus become so popular? What made Him a celebrity?

Post the temptation episode, following events happened:

* Jesus in Nazareth Synagogue reads a scroll from Isaiah. Declares: *The Spirit of the Lord is upon me ..* - Luke 4:18-19. For which He was attacked by the synagogue people(luke 4:29-30).
* Jesus healed a demon possessed man inside synagogue (luke 4:31-37)
* Simon's mother-in-law was healed by Jesus (luke 4:38)
* Many sick and diseased were healed
* Jesus heals a leper! (luke 5: 12-16)
* Healing of the paralytic man (friends who brought him in by the roof) - luke 5:17-26
* Healing of the man with withered hand (luke 6:6-11)

We have a cure for leprosy now. But in those days, it was like a final stagged cancer patient with no hope. Imagine a person who can heal final stagged cancer patient with an instant treatment (not more than a minute). HashTags would have went trending in twitter.

So, this is how Jesus became a celebrity and that answers *How great crowd ?* quesiton.

## Observations

Poor in spirit: physically poor | their is the kingdom of Heaven.
Who mourn or cry | shall be comforted.
The meek: quiet, gentle, patient, submissive | shall inherit the earth: earthly blessings; like luxury.
Who hunger & thirst for righteousness: who desires always to do the right thing; to be good; to be holy; to be pleasing God | shall be satisfied.
The merciful: shows some mercy; helping subordinates | shall receive mercy; positive karma (3rd newton's law)
Pure in heart | shall see God
Peacemakers | shall be called sons of God.
Who are persecuted for righteousness' sake | theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.
When been reviled, persecuted, undergoes all kinds of evil on God's account | Rejoice! Reward is great in Heaven.

## Interpretation

Verse 1
-------
Jesus went up the mountain seeing the crowd. Did Jesus wanted to be alone?

Or did He move up to address the crowd?

Disciples => refers to the 12 or the crowd (people who are earger to listen to Jesus)?

Jesus sat down. I concluded that it would have been both (the disciples and the crowd).

Verse 3
-------
How can one be poor in Spirit?

Hmm.. refer luke 6:20. Jesus is talking about poor people. Physically poor => their trust is God or if I was poor automatically I would tend to trust God. B'coz ..  nothing else can be done. still its just hypothetical.

* So when a person trusts God or depends on God for everything (in context with the above made hypothetical statement). He is going Heaven for sure.
* Kingdom of Heaven is what is going to be theirs. What should be my attitude when I see a poor person?

Verse 4
-------
People who cry out of suffering. Things will definitely change. Its a promise.

Verse 5
-------
Its a flat rule set by God. World says: "You need to be dominant. Always speak up. Grab the chance." Even when I look at very humble (poochi) person. It gives me this thought that they won't survive. God says: these people who the world things is not good. These very people will inherit earth (become wealthy).

Abram being humble obeyed and got land, gold, abundant cattle, etc.!

Joseph being humble become PM of Egypt & got huge land

So worldly possessions will follow people who are not having pride and is submissive to God.

Verse 6
-------
Doing the right thing always.

Justice; Making sure things are happening with justice.

Satisfied: the feeling of being content. Happy life. A feeling of living life with purpose (great purpose). The feeling I get when someone is benefitted by me.

* Giving way to ambulance
* Praying for a person and that person's problem gets solved. God answers.

Verse 7
-------
Positive karma.

Be merciful. God shall make sure that I get mercy when needed.

How can I be merciful ? *still thinking*

Verse 8
-------
**Pure in heart**

Being really good from the inside.

Always praying.

Never sin.

Helping people.

Not having ego.

Forgiving people.

Obeying authorities.

Being honest.

No lies.

**TOO TOUGH**
But if I do it or if I become like it (again hypothetically). I shall see God!

Like Jacob (Gen 32:30); Moses (Exo 3:6); Isaiah (Isa 6:1).

Verse 9
-------
Get oneself dirty inorder to bring peace.

World says - "Why to indulge in other person's matters. Nose putting.."

Benefit: He/she shall become children of God. A prestigeous role. like Vice President.

So get involved. Get dirty or atleast TRY.

Verse 10
--------
Getting hurt for doing the right thing.

Being questioned. Hitting the gaints and monsters knowingly that it will lead to bad consequences.

Selfless. Only focusing on the outcome (righteousness).

Even these people will be going to Heaven. Property is ready (paper works will be done instantly in Heaven).

Do I believe this? Can I believe this? Can I live exhibiting this belief in actions?

Verse 11
--------
Being teased as Pastor. Being made fun as innocent. Am I first trying to share the Truth? or Atlease live the Truth. Practicing the Truth.

Verse 12
--------
Reward in Heaven; Ranks shall be given in Heaven. So Rejoice! Keeping eye on the prize. B'coz the prophets; legends who were before.. also earned their badges the same way.

## Application

* My attitude towards poor; Should change their house; possessions are in Heaven.
* When I'm down; tough phase in life. Remember God will comfort me. Coz He has promised!
* Be humble. Obey teachers. Respect elders.
* Strive hard to do the right thing.
* Be merciful. Especially when someone does wrong to me. Especially people who don't deserve.
* Become really a good person from inside.
* Get involved and bring peace.
* Don't / Never worry when being hard pressed for doing the good. Remember when I do good. I will get rewarded with bad/hurt. But never lose heart. Remember the prize in Heaven & fix eyes on the prize.
