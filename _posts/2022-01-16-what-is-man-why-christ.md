# 2 Corinthians 5: 16-21
<sup>16</sup> From now on, therefore, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we once regarded Christ according to the flesh, we regard him thus no longer. <sup>17</sup>Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.<sup>18</sup> All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation; <sup>19</sup>that is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation.<sup>20</sup> Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.<sup>21</sup>For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God. 

This is a letter written by Paul to Corinthians. Let me highlight two words and its meaning which caught my attention.

Reconciliation: Restoration of a friendly relationship

Implore: Beg someone earnestly or desperately to do something


## Observation
V16. Don’t value people by flesh – why? V15 Because all have died. Earlier Christ was valued in flesh. But not anymore.

V17. Anyone in Christ (a.k.a believer) is a new creation. Old is gone. New has come.

V18. This was planned by God. The new creation concept was created by God. He (God) reconciled (restored) us (humans) to Himself through Christ.

* God gave the disciples the job of reconciliation.

V19. God uniting the world to Himself in Christ. Without charging mankind for all the non-sense and sins he committed. And entrusting/putting in charge the disciples the plan of God: reuniting human to Himself.

V20. Thus every believer is an ambassador (representative) for Christ. God making His appeal through believers.

* Paul and team begs the listeners on behalf of Christ to be reunited with God.

V21. Because God made Jesus ‘sin’, who knew no sin – for humans’ sake, so that humans can become righteousness of God.

## Interpretation
V16. Christ died for all. So do not regard people according to flesh. Because according to flesh. Everyone sinned/corrupted. But Christ alone even in flesh he did not sin. So Christ alone was regarded even in flesh, but only once. Not anymore. Why? Because (reason derived on own): He is risen. No longer in flesh. He is with God.

V17. What is it to be in Christ? Participating in the death of Christ which God planned to restore humans.

* So if a person participates in the death of Christ. He becomes a new creation, because a death has happened.

V18. Why God wanted to reconcile/restore mankind to Himself? Something was broken. By default, all humans were disconnected from God.

* God created man to have a relationship with him, a friendly relationship. Not to rule.

* But because of first man sin. All his descendants were in sin and sin breaks the connect which man once had with God.

<u>Ministry of reconciliation:</u>

Ministry: Government department. A department in heaven? For a specific reason.

V19. In Christ, God was reconciling the world to Himself.

V20. A task for every believer. A role of every believer. To be the ambassador for Christ. Making God’s appeal to all.

Implore: Begging/desperately wanting people to be restored to God. Why? Why did I become believer? Because I messed up my life and wanted a solution. And God heard my prayers. Hence, I took that decision.

V21. God wants us to be righteous. A very high standard of righteousness. Righteousness of God.

## Application
* Do not judge people by their sinful acts. Because they sinned in flesh. In Christ they are a new righteous creation.

*	Own the role set: Ambassadors of Christ. 

*	Desperately request people to accept Christ/reconnect with God. Not namesake or duty based or just occasionally or only once.

## Comments
Man is more. By default, he is limited (disconnected). His life begins when he becomes a new creation in Christ (re-connected) with God.
Christ is the way. Without Christ man cannot connect with God.

Thank you.
