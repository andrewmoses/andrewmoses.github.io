# 2 Timothy 4:1-8
<sup>1</sup> I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom: <sup>2</sup>preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with complete patience and teaching. <sup>3</sup>For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching, but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions,<sup>4</sup>and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander off into myths.<sup>5</sup> As for you, always be sober-minded, endure suffering, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.<sup>6</sup> For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure has come.<sup>7</sup>I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith <sup>8</sup>Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will award to me on that day, and not only to me but also to all who have loved his appearing.


It was indeed a struggle to write this study. Coz it took me a while.. and I feel this study is gonna be a special one.


## Observation
V1. Paul is kind of commanding.. also makes sure that God is witness. As God will judge in his second coming.

V2. Preach the gospel. even when it may not be appropriate. correct if someone is doing something wrong, to the point of disagreement also. Similarly encourage if needed. But everything with complete patience and complete teaching.

V3. There will be a time when people won't listen to advise. They will do all nonsense and go to nonsense teachers who approve their nonsense.

V4. basically they will turn away from God and wander off into myths and nonsense

V5. But for me. Just be mindful. endure troubles/difficulties in life. do spread the news about God/Jesus. Keep focused on what God has for you in your life. fulfill that ministry.

V6. Paul's time has kind of come. 

V7. Paul has fought life, finished the course of life. all through he kept his belief in Jesus

V8. Hence, Paul is confident that he is gonna get the crown of righteousness from God who will award all those who loved God's appearance.

## Interpretation
V1. God being a judge will judge the below things(the stuff mentioned in the passage). Customized judgment.

V2. Preaching about God is not optional stuff. I must always be ready to tell others about Jesus. I need to be correct for that. As i can't be a hypocrite, telling one thing and I myself not following. Example I need to be at peace with my parents and honor them, before I telling someone to honor their parents

V3. World and its people are opposite to God and heavenly things. So eventually people of this world will stop listening to Godly things. They will have all sorts of excuses and reasons and even teachers to satisfy their own selfish evil intended stuff.

V4. The truth is gonna become rare. Not much people will listen to it. uhmm.. like churches becoming empty ? But I am in an era were churches are growing and flourishing. Either I have not reached the time as mentioned in v3. or the churches have stopped telling the truth.

V5. Need to be cautious, there WILL BE STRUGGLES. it's ok. just endure it.

V6. Paul being confident in God. no doubt. sold out for God

V7. It's a battle everyday. Paul completed it, it's not about winning or losing, just complete it with Faith. Coz it's God who brought Paul through, not on his own strength.

V8. Fixing the eyes on the crown, the end result. the confidence that there is eternal life. It's really hard because Paul didn't see it that day. But he believed and he told with confidence.



## Application
V1. God is performing miracles in my life to be shared to others. Its ok even if people don't listen, but I must share the goodness of God

V2. I must preach the gospel. At Least try.

V3. It's ok, even if the people to whom I preach gospel shuts me off or insults me.

V4. Be Careful where I wander to. Am I grounded in the Truth? There could be chances that I have become like the people having itching ears.

V5. ..This space is for the reader to halt and take a moment to think about the areas in their life which needs improvement to make it pleasing to God..

V6. I shld be like Paul. Sold out for Jesus

V7. Faith is all I need. Faith that God will take care of my work and all my concerns.

V8. The things that are unseen. A crown waiting to be kept on my head. Oh what a glorious day that would be. Prepare for it Andy. Envision it. Feel it. Make it your own.



Thank you.
