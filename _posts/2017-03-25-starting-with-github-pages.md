You want to build a site using github pages. Then, the following text is going to help you.

# Step 1

Create an account at github.com (or) just sign in with your credentials if you already have one.

Congo! Take a deep breathe. You are now officially part of the world's largest source code host.

> Source code: a text listing of commands to be compiled or assembled into an executable computer program.

# Step 2

Now we want to create a new repository. You can do it in two ways.

Blue way - Top right side, click the small plus button. Then select the first option - "New repository".

Red way - Click "Start a project" button which is highlighted in red.

# Step 3

This is the most important step. So, kindly pay some attention.

Your repository name should be same as your username followed with '.github.io'. That is, if your username is 'superman' your repository name should be 'superman.github.io'.

My username is 'gatestuts' hence I have entered my repository name as 'gatestuts.github.io'.

This is how GitHub finds out that you want to use its GitHub-Pages feature.

Describe about your repo in the description box. Set it public or private.

> Setting a repo 'Public' doesn't mean that anyone can change your code. It just means that your code will be visible to the public. If you don't want people to sneak into your code pay $7 and make your repo private (if you are a student you can get it for free by signing up for the student developer pack).

Go ahead, click 'Create repository' button highlighted in green.

You will get the below screen - It means that you have successfully created your repository.
