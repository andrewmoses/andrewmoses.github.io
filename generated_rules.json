Fourth, successful revives restore the downed player to 30% health, requiring them to seek healing items afterward. Fifth, revived players experience a 3-second disorientation effect where their vision is blurred and movement is slowed. Sixth, the downed state timer can be extended by up to 5 additional seconds if a teammate is actively attempting a revive, giving more time for completion. Seventh, medic class players can perform faster revives in 3 seconds and restore teammates to 50% health instead of 30%. Eighth, if no teammate attempts a revive within the 15-second window, the downed player automatically enters the full respawn cycle.",

            "description": "Ammunition management is critical to survival and requires strategic decision-making throughout the match. First, all weapons have limited ammunition that does not automatically regenerate, forcing you to scavenge for more. Second, ammo can be found in designated supply crates scattered throughout the map, typically containing 1-2 magazines per weapon type. Third, eliminated enemies drop their remaining ammunition which you can collect by approaching their bodies. Fourth, different ammo types are categorized (light, heavy, shotgun, sniper, explosive) and you can only carry a maximum of 6 magazines per weapon type. Fifth, running completely out of ammo forces you to switch to your secondary weapon or melee attacks. Sixth, certain locations on the map have ammo resupply stations that refresh every 60 seconds but are often contested by multiple players. Seventh, wasting ammunition on suppressive fire or missed shots can leave you vulnerable in critical moments. Eighth, squad members can share ammunition with teammates who are running low, promoting teamwork and communication.",
